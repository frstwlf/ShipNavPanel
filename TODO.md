# ShipNavPanel — state and next steps

Rewritten 2026-07-27. The previous version had accreted every superseded plan
in order, with completed and abandoned items still unticked — misleading to
anyone picking this up cold. Full narrative lives in
[PHASE0-FINDINGS.md](PHASE0-FINDINGS.md), [PHASE1-SWF-FINDINGS.md](PHASE1-SWF-FINDINGS.md)
and [PHASE2-PANEL-PLAN.md](PHASE2-PANEL-PLAN.md).

## Where it is

**v0.3.1 — the Phase 2 panel works in game.** In cruise the scanner key opens a
list of the system's bodies; the mouse wheel moves the highlight and the arrow
previews it; R locks the highlighted body onto the HUD, or clears it if it is
already locked. Closing without confirming changes nothing. Outside cruise the
mod is idle and the scanner key keeps its vanilla job.

Confirmed in game on v0.3.0 ("works exactly as advertised"); v0.3.1 swapped the
confirm key and added the control hint, and its hint row is not yet eyeballed.

> **v0.2.0 was inert and nobody had run it.** Packaging flipped the recon
> defaults off, and two pieces of load-bearing machinery were sitting behind
> those flags:
>
> - `TryInstallInputTap()` was gated on `bLogInput`, so with logging off the tap
>   was never installed — nothing set the cycle request, no body was ever
>   selected, and the arrow never appeared at all.
> - `menus->Register(&OnMenuMovieCreated)` sat inside `if (bLogMenus)`, so the
>   stale-handle teardown never ran and a rebuilt HUD movie left the plugin
>   writing rotation into a destroyed clip.
>
> Both now install unconditionally and log only if asked. The lesson worth
> keeping: **a debug flag must never gate anything the mod needs to work.** When
> promoting recon code to infrastructure, move it out from behind its flag in
> the same commit. Grep for `GetValue()` guarding a `Register`, an install or a
> hook before packaging again.

Build and deploy: `xmake -y` installs straight into the game
(`XSE_SF_GAME_PATH` is set at User scope). `xmake package -y` only when handing
it to someone. Confirm which build actually loaded from the plugin's own version
line, first line of the log.

## Quick reference — the mechanism that works

Everything below is verified in game. No Address Library ids, no Ghidra, no SWF
patching.

| what | where |
|---|---|
| Ship HUD root path | `root1.Menu_mc` (from `IMenu::GetRootPath()`) |
| Reticle | `root1.Menu_mc.Reticle_mc` (`ShipReticle_mc` is a *child* of it) |
| Cruise state | `Reticle_mc.CruiseModeHUDActive` — public getter, true while cruising |
| Data manager | `Shared.AS3.Data.BSUIDataManager` — **fully-qualified path only**; the bare name resolves to nothing |
| Subscribe | `manager.Invoke("Subscribe", …, [feedName, nativeFn])` |
| Feeds used | `TargetLowFrequencyProvider` (name, `uniqueID`, `uTargetType`), `TargetHighFrequencyProvider` (`angleToCrosshair`, `distance`, `screenPositionX/Y`) |
| Feed payload | callback arg is a `FromClientDataEvent`; entries at `.data.targetArray.dataA[]`, index-aligned across both feeds |
| `uniqueID` | a **form id** — `TESForm::LookupByID` gives kPNDT (planet), kSTDT (star), kREFR (POI) |
| `uTargetType` | `TT_STAR`=1, `TT_POI`=4, `TT_SHIP`=5, `TT_PLANET`=7 (full enum in `TargetIconFrameContainer`) |
| Arrow bearing | `rotation = angleToCrosshair` — a **2D screen bearing**, valid for bodies behind the ship |
| Arrow clip | `reticle.CreateEmptyMovieClip(...)` + graphics API (`beginFill`/`moveTo`/`lineTo`/`endFill`) |
| Label font | borrow a whole `TextFormat` via `donor.Invoke("getTextFormat", …)` from `Reticle_mc.ShipReticle_mc.LockOn_mc.LockText_tf` (yields `$MAIN_Font_Bold`); set `embedFonts`, and re-apply `setTextFormat` after every text change |

**Threading:** all Scaleform work must happen inside the data-feed callbacks
(the engine's own UI thread) and be gated on `LoadingMenu`/`MainMenu`. Doing it
from the SFSE per-frame task crashed v0.1.3 inside the AS3 VM. The per-frame
task only bootstraps the subscription.

**Movie rebuilds** happen more often than expected — re-create the arrow, label
and subscription whenever the movie-created callback fires, and drop stale
`GFx::Value` handles.

## Open work

- [ ] **Confirm moon nesting in game (v0.4.1).** Nothing to set up — the plugin
      reads the hierarchy out of `Starfield.esm` on a background thread shortly
      after load and caches it. Look for `[bodies] read N bodies` (first run) or
      `loaded N bodies` (later), then check Kurtz sits indented under Jemison.
- [ ] **Icons** — settlements first (`uPoiType`/`uPoiCategory` sampling), gas
      giants last, since that needs the PNDT layout. See the verdict table in
      [PHASE2-PANEL-PLAN.md](PHASE2-PANEL-PLAN.md).
- [ ] **Cosmetics pass on the panel** — position and size were guessed against
      one resolution. `fPanelOffsetX`/`fPanelOffsetY`/`fPanelWidth` exist for
      exactly this.
- [ ] **Lock-course as a separate opt-in key.** Fully specified, never the
      default confirm — it engages the cruise **autopilot**. Build a params
      object `{uBodyID: <uniqueID>}`, construct `Shared.AS3.Events.CustomEvent`
      (payload is the **2nd** ctor arg, lands in `params`), dispatch via
      `BSUIDataManager.dispatchEvent`.
- [ ] Gas-giant / settlement icons — needs the `uPoiType`/`uPoiCategory` enums
      (sample known locations) and a body-class field that is not in the feed.
- [ ] Cosmetics: arrow size and colour, distance formatting.

## Release checklist

- [ ] **Discard `build/packages/ShipNavPanel-0.2.0.zip`** — that archive is the
      inert build described above. Never hand it to anyone; re-package from
      0.2.1 or later, and only after the in-game test above has actually passed.
- [ ] Flip `frstwlf/ShipNavPanel` public — **GPL obligation** once a DLL is
      distributed (CommonLibSF is GPL-3.0-or-later).
- [ ] Scan history first for `C:\Users\<you>\...` paths and log excerpts; deleting
      a file later does not remove it from history.
- [ ] Decide on the PDB. It ships now deliberately so tester crash logs come back
      symbolised; drop it for a stable release.
- [ ] Mod page should say: cruise-mode only, planets and stars only, and it
      **points rather than targets** — the game's UI layer has no by-id set
      target. Mention `fArrowAngleOffset` / `bArrowInvertAngle` as the first
      thing to try if anyone reports the arrow pointing wrongly.

## Settled — do not re-derive

Each of these cost real time; the reasoning is in the findings docs.

- **The ship HUD's target feed cannot tell a moon from a planet.** Moons arrive
  typed `TT_PLANET`, identical to planets, and nothing in the entry names a
  parent. `BGSPlanet::PlanetData` has no relational field either — temperature,
  density, a surface tree, an orbital angle.
  - **`bIsCelestialParentBody` does NOT mean "has moons".** Ground truth for
    Alpha Centauri: Jemison (moon Kurtz), Bondar (Grissom, Curbeam), Gagarin
    (none), Olivas (Lovell, Chawla, Hawley, Voss, Zamka). The flag was true
    only on Jemison, and Kurtz was the only moon in the feed at all — so it
    reads closer to "is the parent of an entry currently in this list".
  - **Feed order does not group families.** Order was Jemison, Bondar, Gagarin,
    Kurtz, Olivas: Kurtz is two entries from its own parent. A v0.3.3 rule
    built on that assumption indented everything after Jemison and was removed.
  - **The feed also lists only some moons** — one of eight here — so the panel
    is inherently a partial list of the system.
  - **★ The hierarchy is in the PNDT record: GNAM "Galaxy Data" = star system
    id, PARENT planet id, planet id.** Found in xEdit by the tester. Earth =
    (Sol 0, parent 0, planet 3); Luna = (Sol 0, parent 3, planet 11) — a planet
    carries parent 0, a moon carries its planet's id.
  - **★★ GNAM IS NOT IN THE RUNTIME RECORD — that is why four searches failed.**
    The v0.3.8 dump settled it: PNDT objects are allocated back to back with a
    stride of exactly **0x58**, and every word of a record is spoken for —
    `surfaceTree` 0x38, a float 0x40, `temperatureCelcius` 0x44 (20.0 Jemison,
    −83.0 Olivas), `density` 0x48, `periAngleInDegrees` 0x4C (186.0),
    `resourceCreationSpeed` 0x50, **form id 0x54**. Anything past 0x58 is the
    *next planet's record*, which is why every scan turned up pointers and float
    bit patterns. **Do not go looking for it in memory again.** The plugin reads
    GNAM out of `Starfield.esm` itself instead.
  - **Parsing the ESM: two things that will bite.** Every PNDT record is
    zlib-compressed (1765 of 1765), the stream starting 4 bytes in, after a
    `uint32` inflated size. And **`XXXX` carries the real 32-bit length of the
    *next* subrecord**, whose own 16-bit size field then reads 0 — miss that and
    the walk desyncs into the middle of a large payload. It silently cost 1134
    of 1765 records in the prototype, Kurtz among them, while still *looking*
    like a working parse. `tools/ExportBodies.pas` remains as an xEdit-side
    alternative but is no longer needed.
  - **`BGSPlanet::PlanetData`'s member comments are stale AND the struct is
    incomplete.** The comments start at `0x30`, but they were written against a
    `0x30`-byte `TESForm` and `TESForm` is now `0x38` — so the compiler places
    every member eight bytes later than documented (`surfaceTree` 0x38 …
    `resourceCreationSpeed` 0x50), and `static_assert(sizeof == 0x58)` is
    satisfied by padding. Reading `0x4C` as GNAM therefore returned
    `periAngleInDegrees`: v0.3.5 logged "system ids" of 186.0, 77.0, 151.0,
    218.0, 209.0 reinterpreted as integers, and `0x54` returned each body's own
    form id. **GNAM lies past the declared end of the record**, so no offset
    derived from that struct can ever be right. Another instance of the stale
    CommonLibSF layout hazard in `STARFIELD-NOTES.md`.
  - **The offset AND the field order are discovered at runtime, not hardcoded** —
    the record's tail is scanned for a triple that behaves like GNAM (one shared
    system id, small distinct planet ids, at least one body with parent 0, and —
    decisively — at least one body whose parent equals another's planet id). All
    six slot orderings are tried, since xEdit's display order is no guarantee of
    the memory order. Bounded by `VirtualQuery`, as it reads past a declared
    struct.
  - **Anything per-body must be cached, and any scan rate-limited.** v0.3.6 ran
    the whole scan on every low-frequency feed callback because it never
    succeeded, doing a `VirtualQuery` per candidate offset per body on the UI
    thread — the game became a slideshow. Each attempt now snapshots each form
    once and scans plain memory; attempts are 3 s apart and capped at 8; and
    every form's GNAM is cached by form id, since it never changes.
  - **The star map providers are a dead end from the ship HUD.**
    `StarmapSystemBodyInfoProvider` subscribes fine but never fires with the map
    closed — zero callbacks in a full cruise. Its `uBodyType`
    (`BT_STAR`/`BT_PLANET`/`BT_MOON`/`BT_SATELLITE`/`BT_STATION`/
    `BT_ASTEROID_BELT`) would have answered this, but only with the map open.
    Extracted SWFs live in `M:\Starfield\Extracted\interface\` (CWS = zlib from
    byte 8; PowerShell `DeflateStream` after skipping the 2-byte zlib header).
- **A borrowed `TextFormat` carries the DONOR's alignment.** The donor is the
  HUD's centred lock-on caption, so any field using it is centred until `align`
  is set explicitly. Cost one build: the panel shipped with centred names.
- **To suppress an input, hook the receiver that consumes it and splice the
  event out of the queue — do not flag it and hope.** Proven both ways on the
  same day: flagging failed for the throttle, splicing worked for the mouse
  wheel at `PlayerCamera::PerformInputProcessing` (v0.2.3, view unchanged, mouse
  look unaffected). `PlayerCamera` is a `BSInputEventReceiver` with a real
  singleton id, so it takes the same live-vtable hook as `RE::UI`. Relink before
  returning and every other receiver still sees the chain whole.
- **Ship flight input cannot be suppressed by marking events `disabled`**
  (tested v0.2.1). The write lands and even persists — the engine pools the
  event objects, so a later press arrives still carrying the flag — and the ship
  accelerates regardless. Either the flight consumer runs before `RE::UI` in the
  receiver chain, or it ignores the flag; the log cannot tell which, and it does
  not matter. **The panel must use keys the game already ignores in cruise.**
- **`disableplayercontrols` is not an alternative** — it drops the ship out of
  cruise without the hidden loading screen, i.e. outside the cruise state
  machine's normal teardown. Not worth the risk.
- **Vtable ids are healthy; it is the *function* ids that are placeholders.**
  `IDs_VTABLE.h` has zero `{ 0 }` entries, `IDs.h` has 505. So a vtable-based
  hook can use its Address Library id directly — the live-object trick is only
  needed where a *function* id is missing.

- **Targeting a body by id is impossible from the UI layer.** No such event
  exists; `ShipHud_Target` is parameterless ("target what is hovered") and
  `iInfoTargetIndex` is read-only to the SWF. Would need
  `Spaceship::TargetingMode` (vtable **is** mapped: 450764, 450766 — try
  vtable-observation before Ghidra).
- **Targeting picks whatever is nearest screen centre**, and that reticle is
  fixed; the mouse circle steers only. Free-look does **not** allow targeting.
- **No cruise targeting-cone setting exists** — all 2426 GMSTs swept
  (`..\tools\Dump-Gmst.ps1`); `setgs` on the candidates changed nothing.
- **Interposing on `ShipReticle` methods is impossible** — sealed AS3 class,
  methods are read-only fixed traits. Its data members are `private` and so
  unreadable from outside.
- **Whole-class AS3 replacement in JPEXS 10.0.0 silently drops code** — proven by
  a no-op round trip. Use P-code on a single method body if a patch is ever
  needed. (Their JPEXS is from 2016; a newer build may behave.)
- **The star-map route subsystem is galaxy-map/grav-jump machinery**, unrelated
  to cruise.
- **A `TT_STAR` entry may be in another system** (one showed at ~87 ly), so
  filter by type **and** distance.
- **Do not enumerate the space cell** — `TESObjectCELL::ForEachReference` on
  cell `0x18343` crashed every attempt during the SeamlessGravJumps triage.
